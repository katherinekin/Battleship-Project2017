# Battleship-Project2017

Constructs a single player battleship game against a CPU on a 10x10 grid.
Each player has 1 Carrier (size 5), 1 Battleship (size 4), 1 Cruisers (size 3), 1 Submarine (size 3), and 1 Destroyers (size 2).
As each player tries to take out their opponent, the board response will tell them if they got a hit or miss, and if a ship has been sunk.
The first player to take out all of their opponent's ships is the winner.
